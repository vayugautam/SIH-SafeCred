## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Test ML Application API (Recommended! ⭐)

```bash
# 1. Install ML dependencies
cd ml
pip install -r requirements_ml.txt

# 2. Start the application processing API
python application_api.py

# 3. Test with demo HTML (open in browser)
# Open ml/demo_application.html
# OR run automated tests:
python test_application_api.py
```

**Server starts on:** `http://localhost:8001`

**Try it now:**
1. Open `ml/demo_application.html` in your browser

## 📡 API Endpoints

### 🌟 NEW: Application Processing API

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8001`

#### Submit Loan Application
**POST** `/apply`

Request:
```json
{
  "applicant": {
    "name": "Ramesh Kumar",
    "mobile": "9876543210",
    "age": 35,
    "has_children": true,

    "loan_amount": 50000,
    "tenure_months": 12,
    "purpose": "Business expansion"
  },
  "declared_income": 25000,
  "consents": {
    "recharge": true,
    "electricity": true,
    "education": false
  }
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "application_id": "APP20251014103000",
  "status": "approved",
  "risk_band": "Low Risk",
  "loan_offer": 26000,
  "interest_rate": 8.5,
  "ml_probability": 0.856,
  "composite_score": 78.5,
  "final_sci": 82.3,
  "message": "Congratulations! Your loan application has been approved...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T10:30:00"
}
```

**📚 Complete API Documentation:**
- Interactive docs: `http://localhost:8001/docs` (when server running)
- Integration guide: [`docs/frontend-integration.md`](docs/frontend-integration.md)
- Quick start: [`docs/QUICKSTART_APPLICATION_API.md`](docs/QUICKSTART_APPLICATION_API.md)

#### How the ML API Works

```
User clicks "Apply" → POST /apply
    ↓
Save application data
    ↓
Extract features (bank, recharge, electricity, education)
    ↓
Run ML model (predict default probability)
    ↓
Calculate composite score
    ↓
Determine risk band (Low/Medium/High/Reject)
    ↓
Calculate loan offer & interest rate
    ↓
Return decision (200-500ms)
```

**Risk Bands & Offers:**

| Risk Band | SCI Score | Base Offer | Interest Rate | Status |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| Low Risk | 80-100 | ₹20,000 | 8.5% | Auto-approved |
| Medium Risk | 60-79 | ₹12,000 | 10.5% | Manual review |
| High Risk | 40-59 | ₹6,000 | 12.5% | Manual review |
| Reject | 0-39 | ₹0 | - | Rejected |

**Consent Bonuses:**
- Each consent (recharge/electricity/education): +₹1,000 to ₹3,000
- Maximum bonus: ₹9,000
- Encourages data sharing for better assessment

### Phase 0 Endpoints (Original Backend)

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:5000`

#### Create User
**POST** `/api/users`  
Request:
```json
{
  "name": "Vayu",
  "mobile": "9956189165",
  "email": "vayu@example.com"
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "id": "user_abc123",
  "name": "Vayu",
  "mobile": "9956189165"
}
```

---

### Create Loan Application
**POST** `/api/applications`  
Request:
```json
{
  "userId": "user_abc123",
  "income": 40000,
  "loan_amount": 120000,
  "tenure_months": 12
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "applicationId": "app_9876",
  "status": "CREATED"
}
```

---

### Upload Document
**POST** `/api/applications/:id/documents`  
Multipart form-data fields:  
- `file` → file binary (CSV, salary slip, electricity bill)  
- `type` → `csv` | `salary` | `bill`  

Response:
```json
{
  "documentId": "doc_555",
  "applicationId": "app_9876",

}
```

---

## 🎯 Deliverable before 5 Oct
- Frontend form submits to `POST /api/applications`  
- Documents uploaded via `POST /api/applications/:id/documents` and received by backend  
- Application status flows from `CREATED → READY_FOR_SCORING`  

---
## 🔧 Test commands (using curl)

**Create user:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/users \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"Vayu","mobile":"9999999999"}'
```

**Create application:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/applications \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"userId":"user_abc123","income":40000,"loan_amount":100000,"tenure_months":12}'
```

**Upload document:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/applications/app_9876/documents \

-F "type=salary"
```

## 🧪 Testing the ML Application API

### Method 1: Demo HTML (Easiest!)
1. Start API: `python ml/application_api.py`
2. Open `ml/demo_application.html` in browser
3. Fill form or press **Ctrl+Shift+D** for demo data
4. Click "Apply for Loan"
5. See instant results!

### Method 2: Automated Tests
```bash
cd ml
python test_application_api.py
```

Tests include:
- ✅ Health check
- ✅ Low risk application (auto-approval)
- ✅ Medium risk application (manual review)
- ✅ New user application
- ✅ Status check

### Method 3: cURL
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/apply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "applicant": {
      "name": "Test User",
      "mobile": "9876543210",
      "age": 30,
      "has_children": false,
      "is_socially_disadvantaged": false
    },
    "loan_details": {
      "loan_amount": 30000,
      "tenure_months": 12,
      "purpose": "Business"
    },
    "declared_income": 25000,
    "consents": {
      "recharge": true,
      "electricity": true,
      "education": false
    }
